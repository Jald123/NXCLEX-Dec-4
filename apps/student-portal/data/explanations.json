    "correctAnswerRationale": "Administering oxygen is the priority intervention for a client experiencing chest pain. Oxygen helps reduce myocardial oxygen demand and can alleviate ischemic pain. This addresses the immediate physiological need and follows the ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) priority framework.",
    "distractorRationales": [
      {
        "optionId": "1",
        "rationale": "While obtaining vital signs is important, it is not the priority action. The client's immediate need for oxygen takes precedence over assessment data collection."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "2",
        "rationale": "Administering pain medication may be appropriate after oxygen is provided, but addressing the underlying cause (potential myocardial ischemia) with oxygen is the priority."
      },
      {
        "optionId": "4",
        "rationale": "Notifying the physician is important but should occur after initial interventions. The nurse should first address the client's immediate physiological needs."
